## Empirical Macroeconomics: Identification, Heterogeneity, Aggregation
### 2nd year PhD course, Northwestern

### Summary:
This is a course on modern empirical macroeconomics, covering recent advances
on identification and how micro data can be used to better understand macro phenomena.
We survey the recent surge in empirical work in macro and discuss how putting more emphasis on
research design combined with more and better data has improved credibility and transparency,
and how the new evidence can help to discriminate among competing theories.

The course has the aim to build up empirical tools and bring students to the research frontier.
We will cover two distinct approaches to empirical macro. The first exploits time-series variation
for identification, exploiting narrative, high-frequency or other external information, and is topdown:
we start by identifying the macro effect and map out the heterogeneous effects after. The
second approach is bottom-up: we start from micro data, such as cross-sectional or panel data
on households, firms, or regions, to estimate a partial-equilibrium effect and impose additional
structure to back out the aggregate effect, e.g. using a structural model or sufficient statistic approach.
Throughout the course, we will cover exciting applications, ranging from the transmission
of monetary and fiscal policy to the aggregate and distributional effects of energy price shocks and
climate policy.
